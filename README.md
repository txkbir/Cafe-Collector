# Cafe Collector

This was my first attempt at Web Development in which I built a functional web application using Python. At the core of my project, I employed Flask, a lightweight web framework, to handle routing and serve as the foundation of my server. To ensure an appealing and responsive user interface, I integrated Flask-Bootstrap5, which seamlessly incorporated Bootstrap 5's CSS framework. Managing web forms and user input validation was made straightforward through Flask-WTF and WTForms. For data storage, I opted for CSV files, using them to store cafe information. Throughout the project, Python served as my primary programming language. I also made use of HTML templates to separate application logic from presentation, allowing for dynamic rendering of data from the CSV file to present cafe details to users. Debugging was simplified with Flask's built-in debugging features, and, as is customary in Flask projects, I served static assets like CSS and JavaScript files to enhance the user experience and functionality of my web application.
